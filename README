This project is based on Word Predictor. Word prediction works like this. As a student types, the software monitors the input letter-by-letter, and produces a list of words beginning with the letter sequence recorded. Each time a letter is added, the list is updated. When the target word appears in the list, it can be chosen and inserted into the ongoing text with a single keystroke.
The include.docx file includes the code for the project and the wordlist.txt file includes the list of words available in the dictionary.
Run the code and use wordlist file in the code to use that dictionary for the word prediction. Data Strucure used in this project is known as Trie which is an enhancement over
other searching and lookup techniques.
Enjoy!
